### Mobile Application (Client)

The MediMitra client offers a rich, intuitive user experience with a **fully shared UI and business logic** across both Android and iOS, thanks to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM).

    * Place new orders.
    * View active orders.
    * Access past order history.
* **Promotions:** Discover and apply special offers and discounts.
* **Seamless Cross-Platform Experience:** Built with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) for a native look and feel on both Android and iOS from a single codebase.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM):** For shared business logic and UI across Android and iOS.
* **Kotlin:** Primary programming language.
* **Jetpack Compose:** (Likely used for Android UI)
* **SwiftUI:** (Likely used for iOS UI)

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that‚Äôs common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple‚Äôs CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you‚Äôre sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
